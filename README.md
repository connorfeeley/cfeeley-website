# About

This is repository contains the sources for my personal site.

The entire site is generated by `publish.el` based (primarily) on the
`org` files under `content/`.

# Commands

## Nix `devshell` commands

Using my nix `progenix-std` devshell:

``` shell
nix develop ~/source/progenix-std#cf-site-shell --command menu
```

``` shell
nixago: updating repositoriy files

[site]

  publish         - Generate website by calling publish.el
  readme          - Export README.org to README.md

```

## Generate the site

Simply run `publish` from inside the devshell:

``` shell
publish
```

Alternatively, run the `publish` command from outside the devshell:

``` shell
nix develop ~/source/progenix-std#cf-site-shell --command publish
```

## Export `README.org` to `README.md`

Since sourcehut doesn't support `org` README files, we need to convert
it manually by running the `readme` devshell command:

``` shell
readme
```

Alternatively, run the `readme` command from outside the devshell:

``` shell
nix develop ~/source/progenix-std#cf-site-shell --command readme
```
