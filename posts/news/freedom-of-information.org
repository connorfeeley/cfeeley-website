I started a series of articles ostensibly about Toronto's public bike share program.

At least, it's ostensibly about Bike Share Toronto.
It's also equal parts about e-bikes, civic governance, and freedom of information requests.

Part 1 is here: [[/city-stuff/freedom-of-information/toronto-foi-request][1: The Good, the Bad, and the E-Bike]] (though it's still a work in progress).
